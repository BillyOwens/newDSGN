Avoid procrastination – this is when you do everything else but the task you need to do. It’s normal to procrastinate a little. However, too much can just add to your stress and result in you not giving yourself enough time to prepare. Managing your time and setting realistic goals for each study session can be helpful ways to avoid procrastinating and make tasks seem less overwhelming.

Make a study timetable – write down all the things you need to do each day of the week and how long you need for each, including time for enough sleep, relaxation and exercise. Find out the date of each exam and work out a study timetable leading up to them. Include tests that help identify gaps in your knowledge. This can give you some direction and help you focus on what to study each week or day.

Use your lunchtime – studying in the school library during your lunchtime gives you access to lots of information available on the reference shelves. Some material, such as sample solutions, often can’t be taken out of the library or can be too long to photocopy
