 
Study area – having a good study area can make a huge difference to how well you learn. Study in a well-lit, quiet area, away from noises and people in the house. If this isn’t possible, it might be better to study at the library.

Make sure your desk is tidy and organised – it means you can concentrate on studying and learning, not trying to find information.

Find out about the exam – find out what format the exam will take – are the questions in essay, short answer or multiple-choice format? Is the exam open book or closed book? Knowing how the exam is marked and what proportion of your total mark it’s worth might also be helpful.

To do lists – make a to do list before each study session. Breaking tasks down into small, manageable chunks will make it less overwhelming. Cross them off as you go.

Past exam papers – ask your teacher for past exam papers. They can be a useful insight into what your exam will be like and also provide a guide for what you know and the areas where you need help. If possible, practice some under exam conditions and get your teacher to mark them
